```python
# Example queries you can try:
queries = [
    "What are methods for identifying biological networks?",
    "How to handle noisy data in system identification?",
    "What are the challenges in modeling biochemical reactions?",
    "How to ensure model identifiability in biological systems?",
    "What are sparse regression techniques for system identification?"
]
```

To use these different queries, you can modify the test_query line in the code:

```python
test_query = "How to handle noisy data in system identification?"
```
